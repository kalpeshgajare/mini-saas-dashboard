# Mini SaaS Dashboard with Firebase Auth & Firestore
A modern, responsive SaaS-style dashboard built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. This project demonstrates a full-stack, production-ready mini application that allows authenticated users to manage their own set of projects in a secure and isolated environment using Google Firebase's powerful Authentication and Firestore database services.

Whether you're building a portfolio, a client workspace, or an internal tool, this project serves as a solid starting point for scalable web apps that require authentication and per-user data management.

### Technologies Used
- **React**: Frontend framework.  
- **Firebase**: For Authentication (Google Sign-in) and Firestore database.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive design and styling.  
- **React Context API**: For global state management.  
- **Firestore**: For storing user data and projects.  

### Setup & Installation Instructions
#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Create a Firebase project and set up Authentication and Firestore.
Follow [this Firebase guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) to create a Firebase project.
#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalpeshgajare/mini-saas-dashboard.git
cd mini-saas-dashboard
```
#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
#### 3. Configure Firebase
Create a .env file in the root of the project.
Add your Firebase credentials in the .env file as shown below:
```env
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your-api-key
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
```
You can find these credentials in the Firebase Console under Project Settings.

#### 4. Start the Development Server
Once the Firebase configuration is done, you can start the app with:
```bash
npm start
```

### How to Use
