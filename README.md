# Mini SaaS Dashboard with Firebase Auth & Firestore
A modern, responsive SaaS-style dashboard built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. This project demonstrates a full-stack, production-ready mini application that allows authenticated users to manage their own set of projects in a secure and isolated environment using Google Firebase's powerful Authentication and Firestore database services.

Whether you're building a portfolio, a client workspace, or an internal tool, this project serves as a solid starting point for scalable web apps that require authentication and per-user data management.
